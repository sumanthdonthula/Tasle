Background and Motivation:

Tasle is a repository which will take input video which has lines and cars on road and will detects cars, and lines on road.

This is a basic repo which uses some of the ideas of self-driving car working principle.

I have used a video which I recorder on road while travelling. You can access it from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VrFB6E6vBjlCYJNyJ7xty-ogqFvidowH/view?usp=drive_link.

I have placed my file in a google drive. The notebook I have shared is a work on Colab, and I have mounted my drive in colab.

Running:
If you run the notebook it will generate an MP4 file with the lines and cars detected boxes, back in drive.
